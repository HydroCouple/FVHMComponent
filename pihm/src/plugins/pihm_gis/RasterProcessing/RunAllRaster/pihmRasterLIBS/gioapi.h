 * CLYRIO : Access operations on Grids
 * -----------------------------------
 */

/*
 * PURPOSE
 *
 * CLYRIO performs I/O operations on grids.
 * It consists of a library of C functions that allow the user
 * to read and write raster data by row, rectangle or cell
 * to or from a specified area of a grid at a specified resolution. 
 * It handles windowing, resampling, 
 * attribute access and data compression 
 * in a manner transparent to the application program.
 */

/*
 * IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 * Grids are based on a locational data model in which space is partitioned
 * into square cells. Each cell in a grid stores a numeric value.
 * Integer Grids are also accompanied by Value Attribute Tables that
 * can store attributes defined on the set of values for a grid. 
 *
 * A grid exists in a cartesian coordinate system, and the rows and columns in the
 * grid are parallel to the axes of the coordinate system.
 * Grids in a database that are used for joint analysis
 * need not be at the same resolution
 * or cover exactly the same spatial area
 * but they must be in the same map projection.
 * 
 * Grids are implemented using a tiled raster data structure
 * in which the basic unit of data storage is 
 * a rectangular block of cells. 
 *
 * A Cell Layer is a raster layer defined
 * by a grid name and optionally an item name in the VAT.
 * The CLYRIO module allows an aplication program to
 * create, open and close cell layers and 
 * to read and write data from and
 * to cell layers. 
 * All access to the data in a cell layer is 
 * made through a rectangular window in cartesian (map) coordinate space.
 * The extent and resolution of 
 * this window must be set by the application program by calling
 * the WindowSet routine, prior to performing any
 * I/O operations.
 * Once a window has been set, an application program can access the cells 
 * in a cell layer by row, rectangle, or cell - all specified 
 * relative to the virtual raster represented by the window.
 *
 * The I/O units used by the application program are  
 * the Window-Row spanning the width of the window, the Window-Band consisting
 * of a set of contiguos rows, the Window-Rectangle consisting of a 2D rectangle
 * contained in the window and, the Window-Cell consisting of a single cell
 * specified by its window row and column coordinates.
 * All cell data is automatically resampled to the window cell size on retrieval
 * during row and cell access. 
 *
 * An application program can either set a global window 
 * that is applied to all cell layers accessed or set a separate 
 * window for each layer accessed. The latter mode is suitable 
 * when transforming a grid from one coordinate system to another
 * such as during warping or projection. 
 * 
 * Grids may be integer or floating point.
 * Integer grids are accompanied by a Value Attribute Table.
 * The CLYRIO module supports spatial access to the numeric value 
 * attributes associated with a grid by supporting 
 * a grid.item naming convention for cell layers that correspond 
 * to grid value attributes.
 * If an item name is specified when a Cell Layer is opened
 * for read access then the values returned for the cells retrieved
 * will be the values for the specified item.
 *

/* 
 * Creating, Opening and Closing Grids :

 * CellLayerCreate - Create a new Cell Layer using the default blocksize.
 * CellLayerCreateTiled - Create a new Cell Layer using the specified blocksize.

 * CellLyrCloseNoVat - Close an opened or created Cell Layer, 
 *                     does not build VAT.
 * CellLyrDelete - Delete a cell layer.
 *
 * IO mode 
 * -------
 *
 * The client is responsible for selecting an IO mode
 * when opening or creating a cell layer and for using 
 * the access method appropriate for the current IO mode.
 * The IO mode can be reset while the layer is opened.
 * The permissible values for IO mode are
 * ROWIO, ROWRUNIO, CELLIO, REGIONIO, REGIONRUNIO, BLOCKIO and BLOCKRUNIO
 * For a more detailed description of these modes see the
 * section on IO mode below.
 *
 * ReadWriteFlag
 * -------------
 * A celllayer is opened READONLY or READWRITE 
 *
 * Compression
 * -----------
 *
 * Integer grids are stored in a run length compressed format.
 * Floating point grids are stored in uncompressed format.

 * CLYRIO mantains an internal cache of block buffers for each opened grid.
